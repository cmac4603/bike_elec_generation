####A lot of versions for this, because it was a long & laborious process with many additions with each step
#####BELGen v1.0 - Initial example from ABElectronics Git repo
#####BELGen v1.1 - Slight mods with circuit
#####BELGen v1.2 - Trying to calculate resistance
#####BELGen v2.0 - Using wrapper function for zero readings
#####BELGen v2.1 - Resistance given global variable 'r'
#####BELGen v3.0 - Introducing button press on RPi GPIO pin
#####BELGen v3.1 - Working on while loop
#####BELGen v3.2 - Button press now initiates voltage/current/resistance readings correctly
#####BELGen v3.3 - Tidying of annotations/ADC channel configs
